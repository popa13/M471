# A note to the reader
This repository is the culmination of the work collected while teaching the course *Probability* (M471) at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa in the Fall of 2023. I have also created a website for the course https://mathopo.ca/courses-website/math-471/math-471.

The lecture notes from which I lectured are found in the folder *0-LectureNotes*.

For the problems sets and their solutions, these can be found directly in the folder *1-ProblemSet*.

# Description of individual Folders
The project is divided into different folders for better organization.

## Lecture Notes
In the folder *0-Lecture Notes*, the complete .tex and .pdf file of the lecture notes are in that file. The reader may use the *Probability.pdf* file to distribute or to have them to lecture in class. There are already compiled. 

If someone wants to modify something in a chapter, the person should first make the modification in the .tex file with the same name of the chapter, save the file, and then compile the file *Probability-All.tex* so that the modifications appear in the main file of the lecture notes. Make sure you know how to compile .tex files. You can download an app such as TexMaker if you are just started to use LaTeX.

In the subfiles AppendixL and AppendixS, the reader will find the individual .pdf files of the Appendix L on Logic and Proofs and of the Appendix S on Set Theory from the lecture notes. These should be distributed on the first week to the students. The students should be given time in class to read the Appendix L and Appendix S, and to complete the first homework. These appendices can also be found on the course website in the *In-Class* webpage of the website.

Finally, in Chapter G Example G.1, I usually ask the students to perform this experiment in class. 

## Problems Sets
In the folder *1-ProblemSet*, all the problems sets and their solutions can be found there. You can access the .tex file and recompile them if necessary. 

For every chapter, I assigned problems from the problems set of the chapter. The homework was due a week after the date we completed covering the material for that chapter. Here is the list of homework problems that I assigned during the 2023 Fall semester:

  - Chapter L: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.
  - Chapter S: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8.
  - Chapter A: 3, 4, 5b, 6, 7, 9, 13.
  - Chapter B: 3, 6, 9, 12, 14.
  - Chapter C: 2, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17.
  - Chapter D: 3, 4, 6, 7b, 11, 13, 17.
  - Chapter E: 3, 4, 6, 11, 12.
  - Chapter F: 1, 2, 3, 4.
  - Chapter G: No problems assigned.

The final exam was the week after we finished convering the material for Chapter G. I wanted the students to focus on studying for the final. Hence my decision of not assigning any homework problems for Chapter G.

## Syllabus
The syllabus describing the course can be found in the folder *2-Syllabus*. Nothing really special about that... It is a boring syllabus. 

Nonetheless, you can find in this folder a file named *timeline-Fall2023.pdf* where I recorded which chapter was covered on which week during the 2023 Fall semester. It can be really useful if you plan to teach the class using my lecture notes.

## Final Exam 
The final exam I gave to this class can be found in the folder *3-FinalExam*. The questions on the exam were directly selected from the Problem sets. The students were aware of that, so they could prepare adequately for the Final exam by trying all of the problems in the Problems Sets.

## Presentation
At the beginning of each semester, I will talk a little bit about myself on the first lecture. I explain where I come from (French Canadian), where did I study, who's my wife, and give them a French test (this usually counts for 25% of their final grade... just kidding!!). You will find the presentation that I use to support my talk in the folder *Presentation*.

# Final Notes
I hope this project will help you start your course at UH Manoa (or anywhere else). If you have any comments, you can always send me an email at parisepierreolivier@gmail.com.

## More active learning
During the semester, I did offer a lot of time for students to work in class on the homework problems. In fact, they had a whole lecture (50min) after the material of a chapter was completed to work on the homework problems. Even after doing that, one thing I would really like next time I teach a similar course is to incorporate more active learning activities to do during lectures with the students. 

One such attempt was made in Example G.1 from Chapter G in the lecture notes. During lecture, I asked my eleven students to roll 10, 20, 40, and 60 times (in fact) an electronic dice (see the link in the lecture notes) and record their results. I asked them to compute the average and I recorded their results on the board. I then asked them where do they think the average will converge? I then explain the Mean-Square Law of Averages for uncorrelated random variables with the same averages. 

## Contributions from the community
If you wish to contribute to the project in any way (like correcting a typo in the lecture notes, adding more problems to the problem sets, adding activity sheets to do in class for active learning, etc), you are welcome to do so. Just clone the project, add your modification and ask for a pull request! I will analyse your modifications and will see if it fits in the project!

*Mahalo nu lui* to anyone contributing to this project.
