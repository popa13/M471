These notes were written during the Fall 2023 semester while I was teaching the course \textit{Probability} (M471) at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. They were inspired by two main resources:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Probability: An Introduction} by Geoffrey Grimmett and Dominic Welsh.
\item \textit{Mathematical Statistics with Applications} by Dennis D. Wackerly, William Mendenhall III, and Richard L. Scheaffer.
\end{itemize}

I aimed to model these notes on a class I wish I had at the undergraduate level. One thing I wished I had seen in my undergraduate probability class is how closely probability is tied to measure theory. This is why, in Chapter A, I provide a gentle introduction to Probability Space and how it is used to construct a probability measure. I tried to make this encounter with measure theory as friendly as possible and hope I have accomplished that goal.

Chapters B and C introduce the basic concepts of probability and discrete random variables. The last four chapters (D, E, F, G) introduce continuous random variables and their vector-valued analogues. Each chapter concludes with exercises followed by their solutions.

I hope these notes will help readers grasp the essence of probability.
